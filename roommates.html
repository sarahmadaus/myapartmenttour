        <h2>hi, I'm Sarah!</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a graduate student at Pratt Institute in New York City, seeking a Masters degree in Library and Information Sciences. Aside from my studies, I'm a freelance writer, brand consultant, and copywrite. You can find my work in Sports Illustrated, Architectural Digest, Town & Country, Allure, Oprah Daily, Well+Good, SELF, The Quality Edit, and more.
            My brand clients include Peloton, Atlas Coffee Club, Swim USA, and Elix Healing.<br><br>
            I'm also an indoor cycling instructor at Equinox. Previously, I spent more than three years at Conde Nast's SELF magazine, first as the editorial assistant, and then as a commerce writer covering new product launches, curating gift guides, and writing service content with e-commerce at the forefront.
            I'm a 2019 Magna Cum Laude graduate of Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I received my B.A. in Journalism with a minor in Business Studies.<br><br>
            During my last year at Temple, I founded the university's first women's lifestyle magazine, REFINE. With a full masthead of dedicated editors, marketing assistants, writers, and designers, I led the team to create two issues during the 2018-2019 academic year and set them up for success once I graduated.
            Throughout my undergraduate career, I was also the Director of Communications and Publicist, respectively, for two Temple Student Government administrations, as well as the Photography Editor of the Templar Yearbook.<br><br>
            On the personal side of things, I live in Bed-Stuy (obviously), and spend a lot of time reading, taking care of my plants, frolicking with my partner's dog Ruby, and working on jigsaw puzzles while I binge watch early-2000s teen dramas.

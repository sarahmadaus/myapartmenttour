            Our Bespoke Glassware and Ceramics
          </div>
          <div class="list-description">
           <p>Both of us enjoy antiquing, thrift shopping, and sourcing oddities from auctions and eBay. Through that, we've found tons of vintage glassware that we love keeping on our open shelving system. We also source whimsical, colorful ceramics from local artisans. Sarah's favorite ceramicist is Philadelphia-based Cloud 9 Clay (linked above).</p>

            Molekule Air Mini+ Air Purifier
          </div>
          <div class="list-description">
          <p>We love cooking in our little apartment, but neither of us can stand food smells. Pair that with NYC's rather poor air quality and our rental's questionable construction, and that's a perfect storm for bad air quality.
                This squat, cute little air purifier is a powerhouse for removing food odors from our home and filtering out dust, mold, and other allergens from the air.</p>

            Samsung The Frame TV
        </div>
        <div class="list-description">
            <p>Yes, this is the famous artwork TV. It has a matte, light-sensitive finish that makes it look like a painting versus a smart TV. One of our favorite things is when someone mentions that our living room doesn't have a TV. And then we point the remote at the Frame and turn it on. They're shocked every single time, and it never gets old.</p>

            Story Bookcase
        </div>
        <div class="list-description">
        <p>My bedroom is very narrow, so I knew I needed a tall and skinny bookshelf. I had seen the famous spine-inspired Story Bookshelf in other design-forward apartments, so I bit the bullet.
                It's an excellent space-saver, and the floating effect makes my books the focal point.</p>

            Eight Sleep Pod Pro 2 Mattress Cover
        </div>
        <div class="list-description">
            <p>This smart mattress cover changed the way I sleep. Though it's not a visible part of our apartment, it made the list regardless. You can set the mattress cover to any temperature and it keeps you from getting too hot or cold.
                As an avid biohacker, I also appreciate that it tracks my sleeping habits and sleep quality, so I can see how my lifestyle affects my Z's.</p>
